## :cat:GPT What is a polynomial feature in linear regression?

In the context of linear regression and machine learning, "polynomial features" refer to a technique used to capture and model non-linear relationships between independent (input) variables and the dependent (output) variable. In linear regression, the model assumes a linear relationship between the independent variables and the target variable. However, many real-world relationships are not strictly linear, and in such cases, polynomial features can be used to better represent these non-linear patterns.

Here's how polynomial features work in linear regression:

1. **Linear Regression Basics:** In a simple linear regression, you have a single independent variable (feature) and a target variable, and you model the relationship between them as a straight line:

   ```
   y = β₀ + β₁ * x
   ```

   Here, `y` is the target variable, `x` is the independent variable, and `β₀` and `β₁` are the coefficients to be estimated.

2. **Polynomial Regression:** In polynomial regression, you introduce polynomial features by adding higher-degree terms of the independent variable to the model. This allows you to capture non-linear relationships. The model becomes:

   ```
   y = β₀ + β₁ * x + β₂ * x² + β₃ * x³ + ... + βₙ * xⁿ
   ```

   In this model, `x²`, `x³`, and so on represent the polynomial features. The coefficients `β₀`, `β₁`, `β₂`, `β₃`, etc., are estimated from the data.

3. **Degree of the Polynomial:** The degree of the polynomial is a hyperparameter that you can choose. A higher-degree polynomial can capture more complex non-linear patterns, but it can also lead to overfitting, so the choice of degree should be carefully considered.

4. **Feature Engineering:** Creating polynomial features involves feature engineering. It means transforming the original independent variable(s) by raising them to different powers (e.g., squaring, cubing, etc.) to introduce non-linearity into the model.

5. **Using Libraries:** Many machine learning libraries provide tools to easily create polynomial features. For example, in Python, the `PolynomialFeatures` class from the scikit-learn library can be used to generate polynomial features for linear regression.

Here's a simple example in Python using scikit-learn to apply polynomial features to linear regression:

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeatures
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import numpy as np

# Sample data
X = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]).reshape(-1, 1)
y = np.array([1, 4, 9, 16, 25])

# Create polynomial features (degree=2)
poly = PolynomialFeatures(degree=2)
X_poly = poly.fit_transform(X)

# Fit a linear regression model to the polynomial features
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_poly, y)
```

In this example, we've applied polynomial features of degree 2, and the linear regression model now captures a quadratic relationship between the input variable and the target variable.
