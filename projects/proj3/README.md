# Project 3: Ridge Regression

Ridge regression refers to the use of linear regression with regularization. Most specifically, using the L2
norm as a regularizer.

***Objectives***

By executing this project, you will be able to

1. Gain understanding on the principles governing the perceptron algorithm
1. Strengthen your understanding of derivation and the gradient descent algorithm.
1. Familiarize with the process of training, validation and testing by splitting the data on your own.
1. Improve your proficiency in the use of coding tools and libraries for machine learning by building a full project from scratch .
---

***Task 1***. You will implement ridge regression from scratch in a file that you will name `ridge.py`. You may use the implementation of linear regression showcased in the course as a starting point. $\underline{ \text{You cannot use scikit-learn. It is expected that you code the algorithm from scratch.} }$

Make sure you debug your code, to verify that it works accordingly. You may consider comparing it against `scikit-learn` implementation for validation.

***Task 2***. Check your implementation using the Olympics 100 m dataset that has been showcased
in several lectures. Are your results similar? How do you choose Î»? Define a strategy for this.

---

## Report:

You need to prepare a 1-page report $\underline{ \text{explaining in detail}}$ the strategy you used to implement ridge
regression. You should illustrate the performance of your implementation in the 100 m Olympics dataset
and comment on the choice of $\lambda$. Optionally, you can compare your implementation to that of `scikit-learn`.


## Deliverables:

Upload a zip file named `<group-name>.zip` containing the report, the `ridge.py` file, any notebooks you
produced and any instructions required to run it.

# Evaluation:

| Criteria | Score |
|-|-|
| our code runs and works as expected on the data | 8 |
| Your code runs on any dataset | 2 |
| Your report | 10 |
| Scikit-learn comparison | 1 |


Important:
- Failing to submit a report leads to a mark of zero (0).
- If ChatGPT is used, failing to report it and explaining its use leads to a mark of zero (0).
- A group will be chosen at random to present their solution during the lecture. Failing to justify the submitted solution leads to a mark of zero (0).
