# Project 3: Ridge Regression

Ridge regression refers to the use of linear regression with regularization. Most specifically, using the L2
norm as a regularizer.

***Objectives***

By executing this project, you will be able to

1. Gain understanding on the principles governing the perceptron algorithm
1. Strengthen your understanding of derivation and the gradient descent algorithm.
1. Familiarize with the process of training, validation and testing by splitting the data on your own.
1. Improve your proficiency in the use of coding tools and libraries for machine learning by building a full project from scratch .
---

***Task 1***. You will implement ridge regression from scratch in a file that you will name ridge.py.
You may use the implementation of linear regression showcased in the course as a starting point.
$\text{ \underline{You cannot use scikit-learn. It is expected that you code the algorithm from scratch.} }$


You may add any other functions that you consider necessary.

Make sure you debug your code, to verify that it works accordingly. You may consider comparing it against `scikit-learn` implementation for validation.

***Task 2***. Document your code.
