# Project 3: Ridge Regression

Ridge regression refers to the use of linear regression with regularization. Most specifically, using the L2
norm as a regularizer.

***Objectives***

By executing this project, you will be able to

1. Gain understanding on the principles governing the perceptron algorithm
1. Strengthen your understanding of derivation and the gradient descent algorithm.
1. Familiarize with the process of training, validation and testing by splitting the data on your own.
1. Improve your proficiency in the use of coding tools and libraries for machine learning by building a full project from scratch .
---

***Task 1***. Your first task will be to code the perceptron algorithm in a file called `perceptron.py`.

This time, you will not be provided with a skeleton file. To be consistent with the previous project,
you will need to create a class named Perceptron, which should have the following two methods:
1. train – with the necessary steps to train a perceptron
2. predict – with the necessary steps to predict the labels y of a group of samples X.

You may add any other functions that you consider necessary.

Make sure you debug your code, to verify that it works accordingly. You may consider comparing it against `scikit-learn` implementation for validation.

***Task 2***. Document your code.
