For a highly condensed overview, here's a streamlined explanation of the usage of the key formulas in their respective contexts:

### Linear Models for Regression
- **OLS**: Estimate regression model coefficients to predict outcomes.

### Linear Classifiers: LDA & Logistic Regression
- **Logistic Regression**: Predict binary outcomes based on a logistic function.
- **LDA**: Classify instances by comparing class likelihoods.

### Gradient Descent
- **Update Rule**: Minimize the cost function by iteratively adjusting parameters.

### The Perceptron & Bias-Variance Decomposition
- **Perceptron**: Update model to classify instances into two classes.
- **Bias-Variance Tradeoff**: Balance model complexity against prediction error.

### Support Vector Machines & Kernels
- **SVM**: Find the maximum margin separating hyperplane for classification.
- **Kernel Function**: Transform data for linear separation in high-dimensional space.

### Regularization and Validation
- **Regularization (L1, L2)**: Control model complexity to prevent overfitting.
- **Cross-Validation**: Evaluate model performance on unseen data.

### Decision Trees and Ensembles
- **Trees**: Split data based on information gain or Gini impurity.
- **Ensembles (Random Forest, Boosting)**: Combine multiple models to improve accuracy.

### Unsupervised Learning
- **k-Means**: Partition data into clusters with minimized variance.
- **PCA**: Reduce dimensionality while retaining most variance.

### Neural Networks
- **Backpropagation**: Optimize neural network weights based on error gradient.

This concise summary encapsulates the core applications of the formulas within each machine learning topic, providing a quick reference to understand their fundamental purposes.
