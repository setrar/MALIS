For an efficient cheat sheet based on the provided lecture topics, focusing on key formulas is crucial. Below is a list of essential formulas and mathematical concepts that are fundamental to understanding the discussed machine learning topics:

### Linear Models for Regression
- **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)**: $\hat{\beta} = (X^TX)^{-1}X^TY$

### Linear Classifiers: LDA & Logistic Regression
- **Logistic Regression Model**: $P(Y=1|X) = \frac{e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1X}}{1 + e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1X}}$
- **LDA Decision Rule**: $X > c$ if $\frac{P(Y=1)P(X|Y=1)}{P(Y=0)P(X|Y=0)} > c$, for some threshold $c$.

### Gradient Descent
- **Gradient Descent Update Rule**: $\theta := \theta - \alpha \frac{\partial J(\theta)}{\partial \theta}$
  
### The Perceptron & Bias-Variance Decomposition
- **Perceptron Update Rule**: If $y_i(\mathbf{w} \cdot \mathbf{x}_i) \leq 0$, then $\mathbf{w} := \mathbf{w} + \eta y_i \mathbf{x}_i$
- **Bias-Variance Tradeoff**: $\text{Error}(x) = \text{Bias}^2 + \text{Variance} + \text{Irreducible Error}$

### Support Vector Machines & Kernels
- **SVM Optimization Problem**: Minimize $\frac{1}{2}\|\mathbf{w}\|^2$ subject to $y_i(\mathbf{w} \cdot \mathbf{x}_i + b) \geq 1$ for all $i$.
- **Kernel Function**: $K(x, x') = \phi(x) \cdot \phi(x')$, for some mapping $\phi$.

### Kernels, Bias-Variance Decomposition, and Regularization
- **Regularization Terms**: 
  - L1: $||\beta||_1 = \sum |\beta_i|$
  - L2: $||\beta||_2^2 = \sum \beta_i^2$

### Regularization, Validation & Trees
- **Cross-Validation Error**: $\frac{1}{k} \sum_{i=1}^{k} \text{Error}_i$
- **Decision Tree Splitting Criterion**: Information Gain, Gini Impurity.

### Ensembles
- **Random Forest**: No explicit formula, but conceptually combines multiple tree predictions.
- **Boosting Weight Update**: Weights updated based on error of previous model's performance.

### Unsupervised Learning
- **k-Means Clustering**: Objective to minimize $\sum_{i=1}^{k} \sum_{ x \in S_i } || x - \mu_i ||^2$, where $\mu_i$ is the mean of points in $S_i$.
- **PCA**: Find the $k$ eigenvectors of the covariance matrix $X^TX$ that correspond to the $k$ largest eigenvalues.

### Neural Networks
- **Backpropagation**: Given a loss function $L$, $\frac{\partial L}{\partial w} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial a} \cdot \frac{\partial a}{\partial z} \cdot \frac{\partial z}{\partial w}$, where $z = wx + b$ and $a$ is the activation.
