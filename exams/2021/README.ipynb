    "   - **Description:** The validation dataset is separate from the training dataset and is not used during the training phase.

    "\n",
    "1. **Mean Training Error**:\n",
    "   - The mean training error is likely to increase as you add more data points. This is because the model might be very well-fitted to a small dataset with few data points (potentially overfitting), having a very low training error. As you introduce more data, it's statistically likely that the new data will not fit the existing model as perfectly, especially if the initial training set was not fully representative of the underlying distribution. The additional data provides a more comprehensive view of the underlying relationship, leading to a regression line that averages out more individual discrepancies.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Mean Testing Error**:\n",
    "   - The mean testing error is generally expected to decrease as the training set size increases, up to a certain point. A larger training set typically allows the model to learn a more general representation of the underlying relationship, which can improve its performance on unseen data, thus lowering the testing error. However, if the model starts to encounter noise in the data as the training size increases, the testing error may stop decreasing and potentially start to increase if the model begins to learn the noise as if it were a valid pattern (though this is less common in linear regression compared to more complex models).\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, increasing the training set size in linear regression tends to result in a better approximation of the underlying data-generating process, which generally means a slight increase in the training error due to reduced overfitting, and a decrease in the testing error due to improved generalization. However, these trends can be influenced by several factors, such as the quality and representativeness of the data, the presence of noise, and the complexity of the true underlying relationship."

    "If you have access to a well-labeled dataset, starting with a supervised approach may be most effective to quickly get a reliable model running. If labeled data is scarce or non-existent, an unsupervised approach will allow you to start identifying anomalies and potentially generate a labeled dataset for future supervised learning. In the context of security and anomaly detection, where new types of attacks are constantly emerging, it's also important to consider semi-supervised or active learning approaches, where the model can learn with a small amount of labeled data supplemented by a larger amount of unlabeled data."
